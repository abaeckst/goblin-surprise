## ✅ Phase 1: Session 3 - Requirements System (COMPLETE)

### ✅ Priority 1: Requirements Upload Interface (COMPLETE)
**Objective:** Create separate interface for uploading target deck requirements

**Implementation Complete:**
- ✅ RequirementsUpload.tsx - Purple-themed requirements upload component
- ✅ UploadModeToggle.tsx - Toggle between "Contribute Cards" and "Set Requirements"
- ✅ RequirementsService.ts - Core MAX quantity calculation logic
- ✅ Database integration for requirement_decks and requirement_cards tables

**Files Created:**
```
src/components/upload/RequirementsUpload.tsx  # Requirements upload ✅
src/components/common/UploadModeToggle.tsx    # Mode switcher ✅
src/services/requirementsService.ts           # Requirements logic ✅
```

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Separate upload mode for target decks
- ✅ Requirements stored with deck association
- ✅ Clear UI distinction between modes (purple vs blue theme)

### ✅ Priority 2: MAX Quantity Calculation Logic (COMPLETE)
**Objective:** Implement calculation for card requirements across multiple decks

**Implementation Complete:**
- ✅ MAX quantity logic: `required_quantity = MAX(quantity)` across all requirement decks
- ✅ Outstanding calculation: `outstanding_quantity = required_quantity - gathered_quantity`
- ✅ Status determination: RED (needed), BLUE (exact), GREEN (surplus)
- ✅ Real-time recalculation on data changes

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Accurate MAX calculation across multiple requirement decks
- ✅ Real-time updates when requirements or contributions change
- ✅ Proper status color coding implementation

### ✅ Priority 3: Dashboard Foundation (COMPLETE)
**Objective:** Build initial dashboard components with progress tracking

**Components Built:**
```typescript
src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx           # Main dashboard ✅
src/components/cards/OutstandingCardsTable.tsx  # Cards still needed ✅
src/components/cards/GatheredCardsTable.tsx     # Cards contributed ✅
src/components/dashboard/ProgressBar.tsx        # Completion status ✅
```

**Core Functionality Delivered:**
- ✅ Complete progress tracking dashboard
- ✅ Outstanding cards table with RED status indicators
- ✅ Gathered cards table with expandable contributor details
- ✅ Visual progress bar with completion percentage
- ✅ Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- ✅ Navigation between Upload and Dashboard views

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Progress bar reflects actual completion percentage
- ✅ Card tables show correct quantities and status
- ✅ Color coding (RED/BLUE/GREEN) for card status implemented
- ✅ Real-time updates when contributions added
- ✅ Mobile responsive design throughout

## ✅ Phase 2: Session 4 - Production Deployment (COMPLETE)

### ✅ Feature 1: Export Functionality (COMPLETE)
**Objective:** Generate acquisition lists for missing cards

**Implementation Complete:**
- ✅ Export outstanding cards as text list
- ✅ Copy to clipboard functionality
- ✅ Format: "4 Lightning Bolt" per line
- ✅ Filter to only cards with outstanding > 0

### ✅ Feature 2: Production Deployment (COMPLETE)
**Objective:** Deploy to GitHub Pages with production configuration

**Implementation Complete:**
- ✅ Configure GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ Optimize build bundle size (2.4MB)
- ✅ Set up environment variables for production
- ✅ Performance optimization and testing (<3s load time)

### Feature 3: Final Polish (30 minutes)
**Objective:** Production-ready UI/UX and error handling

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced error messages and recovery
- Loading state improvements
- Final responsive design validation
- Comprehensive testing with all .dek files

## ✅ Phase 3: Session 5 - MTGO Pricing System (COMPLETE)
**Objective:** Add real-time MTGO card pricing from Scryfall API

**Implementation Complete:**
- ✅ Service: `src/services/scryfallApi.ts` - Full Scryfall API integration
- ✅ Service: `src/services/scryfallPriceService.ts` - Price caching and management
- ✅ Service: `src/services/priceUpdateService.ts` - Background price updates
- ✅ UI: Price and Total Value columns in all card tables
- ✅ Dashboard: Collection Value and Outstanding Value metrics
- ✅ Manual Controls: "Get Prices" and "Refresh Prices" buttons
- ✅ Automatic price refresh (24-hour cache, 6-hour background updates)
- ✅ Rate limiting compliance (10 requests/second)

**Database Updates Applied:**
- ✅ Added `price_tix` column to `card_metadata` table
- ✅ Added `last_price_update` column to `card_metadata` table
- ✅ Added unique constraint on (card_name, set_code)

**Issues Resolved:**
- ✅ Fixed missing database constraint causing upsert failures
- ✅ Fixed metadata joining in RequirementsService to include price data
- ✅ Prices now display correctly throughout the application

## 🎨 Phase 3: Polish and Deployment (Estimated: 1-2 hours)

### UI/UX Enhancement
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Loading states and error boundaries
- Improved visual feedback and animations
- Accessibility improvements

### Production Deployment
- GitHub Pages build and deployment
- Environment variable configuration
- Performance optimization
- Final testing and validation

## 📋 Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions Already Made
- **Client-side Processing:** No server storage, direct Supabase integration
- **Real-time Updates:** Supabase subscriptions for live collaboration
- **No Authentication:** Public contribution model for ease of use
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core features first, polish later

### Data Flow (Established)
```
MTGO .dek Upload → XML Parse → Database Insert → Real-time Update → Dashboard Refresh
```

### Business Logic (Defined)
```typescript
// Card quantity calculations
required_quantity = MAX(quantity) across all requirement_decks
outstanding_quantity = required_quantity - gathered_quantity

// Status determination
if outstanding_quantity > 0: "needed" (RED)
if outstanding_quantity === 0: "exact" (BLUE)  
if outstanding_quantity < 0: "surplus" (GREEN)
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Flexibility

**This plan is a proposal - Claude Code should:**
- Assess current code state and adjust priorities as needed
- Skip any components that are already working correctly
- Focus effort on actual blocking issues vs assumed problems
- Implement in whatever order makes most technical sense
- Add additional features or improvements as appropriate

**Key Principle:** Get to working MVP fastest, then enhance incrementally

---

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (High Confidence)
- Database operations (already working)
- TypeScript compilation (resolved)
- Basic React components (straightforward)
- Supabase real-time subscriptions (documented)

### Medium Risk (May Need Debugging)
- File upload workflow validation
- Calculation engine accuracy
- Scryfall API integration and rate limiting
- Real-time state management

### High Risk (Needs Careful Testing)

- Performance with large datasets
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Production deployment configuration
