## 🔧 Current System Implementation

### Core Services (IMPLEMENTED)
- **Database Service** (`src/services/supabase.ts`) - Connection and CRUD operations ✅
- **XML Parser** (`src/services/dekParser.ts`) - MTGO .dek file processing ✅
  - **Enhanced:** Now supports attribute-based XML format (e.g., Boros Energy deck)
  - **Enhanced:** Automatic sideboard card filtering
  - **Enhanced:** Duplicate card consolidation
  - **Enhanced:** Improved error handling for edge cases
- **Calculation Engine** - Requirements and progress calculations (planned)
- **Scryfall API** - Card metadata integration (planned)

### Components Built
- **App.tsx** - Main application with state management
- **EnvTest.tsx** - Database connection testing and status display
- **FileUpload.tsx** - File upload interface with drag-and-drop
- **UploadResults.tsx** - Upload processing results display

### File Processing System
- **XML Parser:** Enhanced to handle multiple MTGO .dek formats ✅
  - Element-based format (e.g., `<Card><Name>...</Name></Card>`)
  - Attribute-based format (e.g., `<Cards Name="..." Quantity="..."/>`)
  - Automatic sideboard filtering (excludes `Sideboard="true"` cards)
  - Duplicate card consolidation for split entries
- **Test Files:** 8 sample .dek files including new format variations
- **Client-side Processing:** No server storage required, direct database integration

## ✅ Recently Resolved Issues

### Upload Interface (FIXED)
- **Issue:** Upload interface was not visible
- **Solution:** Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration and styling
- **Status:** Upload interface now fully functional

### Parser Compatibility (FIXED)
- **Issue:** Boros Energy deck failed to parse (attribute-based XML format)
- **Solution:** Enhanced parser to handle multiple XML formats
- **Status:** All deck formats now parse correctly

## 📋 Data Architecture

### Database Schema (Deployed)
```sql
-- Core tables operational in Supabase
requirement_decks    -- Target deck tracking
requirement_cards    -- Individual card requirements
gathered_cards       -- Contributor submissions
card_metadata        -- Scryfall API cache
change_log          -- Audit trail for edits
```

### TypeScript Interfaces (Complete)

## 🚀 Development Readiness

### Implementation Plan
Following **UNIFIED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** for structured 4-session development approach:

**Session 1:** ✅ COMPLETE - Upload system working with real-time updates  
**Session 2:** ✅ COMPLETE - Styling fixed, parser enhanced for all formats  
**Session 3:** 🔄 NEXT - Build requirements upload system and calculation logic  
**Session 4:** ⏳ PENDING - Dashboard, testing, and production deployment

### Session 3 Priorities (NEXT)
1. **Requirements Upload System** - Separate interface for target deck definitions
2. **MAX Quantity Calculation** - Logic for determining required quantities across decks
3. **Dashboard Foundation** - Initial progress tracking components
4. **Real-time Subscriptions** - Live updates for collaborative features

### Testing Resources Available
- **Sample .dek Files:** 7 test files covering various scenarios
- **Testing Guide:** Step-by-step validation procedures
- **Error Scenarios:** Invalid XML, missing cards, edge cases

### Deployment Pipeline
- **GitHub Pages:** Configuration ready for production deployment
- **Build Process:** `npm run build` → copy to docs folder → push to GitHub
- **Environment:** Production Supabase credentials configured

## 🔍 Debug Context for Claude Code

### Upload Interface Investigation
**Files to examine:**
- `src/App.tsx` - State management and component integration
- `src/components/upload/FileUpload.tsx` - Upload component conditional display
- `src/components/EnvTest.tsx` - Connection status component

**Expected Debug Process:**
1. Trace `isConnected` state from connection test to UI rendering
2. Verify props passing between App and FileUpload components
3. Check conditional rendering logic in FileUpload component
4. Ensure React state updates trigger proper re-renders

### Console Output (Working)
```
🔄 React: testConnection returned: true
🔄 React: About to call setIsConnected with: true
🔄 React: setIsConnected called
🔄 React: Rendering ConnectionStatus with isConnected = true
🔄 React: isConnected state changed to: true
```

**Status:** Database connection successful, upload interface should be enabled
