# Session 3 Complete: Requirements Upload System

**Date:** 2025-06-29  
**Objective:** Build requirements upload system with MAX quantity calculation logic and real-time dashboard

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Dual Upload System
- **UploadModeToggle.tsx**: Clean toggle between "Contribute Cards" and "Set Requirements" modes
- **RequirementsUpload.tsx**: Purple-themed upload interface for target deck .dek files
- **Visual Distinction**: Clear UI separation between contribution and requirements workflows

### 2. Core Business Logic
- **RequirementsService.ts**: Implements MAX quantity calculation logic
  ```typescript
  required_quantity = MAX(quantity) across all requirement_decks
  outstanding_quantity = required_quantity - gathered_quantity
  ```
- **Status Color Coding**:
  - RED: `outstanding_quantity > 0` (cards still needed)
  - BLUE: `outstanding_quantity === 0` (exact match)
  - GREEN: `outstanding_quantity < 0` (surplus cards)

### 3. Real-time Dashboard
- **Dashboard.tsx**: Main progress tracking interface with navigation
- **ProgressBar.tsx**: Visual completion percentage with stats grid
- **OutstandingCardsTable.tsx**: Cards still needed with RED status indicators
- **GatheredCardsTable.tsx**: Contributed cards with expandable contributor details
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live updates on requirements/contributions changes

### 4. Database Integration
- **Enhanced DatabaseService**: Methods for requirement deck/card operations
- **TypeScript Types**: Updated interfaces for requirement system
- **Error Handling**: Detailed logging for database operations
- **Schema Compatibility**: Fixed database field mapping issues

### 5. App Architecture Updates
- **Navigation System**: Upload vs Dashboard view switching
- **Component Integration**: Seamless flow between upload modes and dashboard
- **State Management**: Proper React state handling for dual modes
