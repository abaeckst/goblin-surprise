**Project:** Goblin Surprise MTG Collection Rebuilder  
**Target:** Production-ready web application  
**Current Status:** Sessions 1, 2 & 3 Complete - Full requirements system with dashboard operational  
**Development Environment:** Claude Code with WSL2

---

## 🎯 Current Development Context

### ✅ Foundation Complete (No Action Needed)
- **React + TypeScript:** Operational development environment
- **Supabase Database:** Connected with deployed schema (5 tables)
- **Dependencies:** All packages installed and configured
- **TypeScript:** Clean compilation, all type errors resolved
- **Environment:** Working `.env.local` with Supabase credentials

### ✅ Recently Resolved Issues
**Upload Interface (FIXED):**
- Tailwind CSS configuration corrected
- Upload interface now fully visible and functional
- File processing working with enhanced parser

**Parser Enhancement (COMPLETE):**
- Added support for attribute-based XML format
- Automatic sideboard card filtering
- Duplicate card consolidation
- Improved error handling

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Session 3 - Requirements System (COMPLETE)

### ✅ Priority 1: Requirements Upload Interface (COMPLETE)
**Objective:** Create separate interface for uploading target deck requirements

**Implementation Complete:**
- ✅ RequirementsUpload.tsx - Purple-themed requirements upload component
- ✅ UploadModeToggle.tsx - Toggle between "Contribute Cards" and "Set Requirements"
- ✅ RequirementsService.ts - Core MAX quantity calculation logic
- ✅ Database integration for requirement_decks and requirement_cards tables

**Files Created:**
```
src/components/upload/RequirementsUpload.tsx  # Requirements upload ✅
src/components/common/UploadModeToggle.tsx    # Mode switcher ✅
src/services/requirementsService.ts           # Requirements logic ✅
```

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Separate upload mode for target decks
- ✅ Requirements stored with deck association
- ✅ Clear UI distinction between modes (purple vs blue theme)

### ✅ Priority 2: MAX Quantity Calculation Logic (COMPLETE)
**Objective:** Implement calculation for card requirements across multiple decks

**Implementation Complete:**
- ✅ MAX quantity logic: `required_quantity = MAX(quantity)` across all requirement decks
- ✅ Outstanding calculation: `outstanding_quantity = required_quantity - gathered_quantity`
- ✅ Status determination: RED (needed), BLUE (exact), GREEN (surplus)
- ✅ Real-time recalculation on data changes

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Accurate MAX calculation across multiple requirement decks
- ✅ Real-time updates when requirements or contributions change
- ✅ Proper status color coding implementation

### ✅ Priority 3: Dashboard Foundation (COMPLETE)
**Objective:** Build initial dashboard components with progress tracking

**Components Built:**
```typescript
src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx           # Main dashboard ✅
src/components/cards/OutstandingCardsTable.tsx  # Cards still needed ✅
src/components/cards/GatheredCardsTable.tsx     # Cards contributed ✅
src/components/dashboard/ProgressBar.tsx        # Completion status ✅
```

**Core Functionality Delivered:**
- ✅ Complete progress tracking dashboard
- ✅ Outstanding cards table with RED status indicators
- ✅ Gathered cards table with expandable contributor details
- ✅ Visual progress bar with completion percentage
- ✅ Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- ✅ Navigation between Upload and Dashboard views

**Success Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Progress bar reflects actual completion percentage
- ✅ Card tables show correct quantities and status
- ✅ Color coding (RED/BLUE/GREEN) for card status implemented
- ✅ Real-time updates when contributions added
- ✅ Mobile responsive design throughout

## 🚀 Phase 2: Session 4 - Production Deployment (Estimated: 1-2 hours)

### Feature 1: Export Functionality (30 minutes)
**Objective:** Generate acquisition lists for missing cards

**Implementation:**
- Export outstanding cards as text list
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Format: "4 Lightning Bolt" per line
- Filter to only cards with outstanding > 0

### Feature 2: Production Deployment (45 minutes)
**Objective:** Deploy to GitHub Pages with production configuration

**Implementation:**
- Configure GitHub Pages deployment
- Optimize build bundle size
- Set up environment variables for production
- Performance optimization and testing

### Feature 3: Final Polish (30 minutes)
**Objective:** Production-ready UI/UX and error handling

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced error messages and recovery
- Loading state improvements
- Final responsive design validation
- Comprehensive testing with all .dek files

### Optional Enhancement: Scryfall API Integration
**Objective:** Add card metadata display (mana cost, type, rarity, color)

**Implementation (if time permits):**
- Service: `src/services/scryfallApi.ts` (partially implemented)
- Fetch card data for display enhancement
- Cache results in `card_metadata` table
- Handle API rate limits and errors

---

## 🎨 Phase 3: Polish and Deployment (Estimated: 1-2 hours)

### UI/UX Enhancement
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Loading states and error boundaries
- Improved visual feedback and animations
- Accessibility improvements

### Production Deployment
- GitHub Pages build and deployment
- Environment variable configuration
- Performance optimization
- Final testing and validation

---

## 📋 Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions Already Made
- **Client-side Processing:** No server storage, direct Supabase integration
- **Real-time Updates:** Supabase subscriptions for live collaboration
- **No Authentication:** Public contribution model for ease of use
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core features first, polish later

### Data Flow (Established)
```
MTGO .dek Upload → XML Parse → Database Insert → Real-time Update → Dashboard Refresh
```

### Business Logic (Defined)
```typescript
// Card quantity calculations
required_quantity = MAX(quantity) across all requirement_decks
outstanding_quantity = required_quantity - gathered_quantity

// Status determination
if outstanding_quantity > 0: "needed" (RED)
if outstanding_quantity === 0: "exact" (BLUE)  
if outstanding_quantity < 0: "surplus" (GREEN)
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Flexibility

**This plan is a proposal - Claude Code should:**
- Assess current code state and adjust priorities as needed
- Skip any components that are already working correctly
- Focus effort on actual blocking issues vs assumed problems
- Implement in whatever order makes most technical sense
- Add additional features or improvements as appropriate

**Key Principle:** Get to working MVP fastest, then enhance incrementally

---

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### Low Risk (High Confidence)
- Database operations (already working)
- TypeScript compilation (resolved)
- Basic React components (straightforward)
- Supabase real-time subscriptions (documented)

### Medium Risk (May Need Debugging)
- File upload workflow validation
- Calculation engine accuracy
- Scryfall API integration and rate limiting
- Real-time state management

### High Risk (Needs Careful Testing)
- Complex UI state interactions
- Performance with large datasets
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Production deployment configuration
